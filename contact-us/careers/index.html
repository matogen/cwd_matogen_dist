              <h4>Minimum requirements</h4>
              <p>
                As a general guideline, we like university graduates with a
                couple of years of experience. But practically we do not believe
                in setting minimum requirements in stone. You might be very
                talented but never had the opportunity to go to a university.
                And we do not want to hold things like that against you.
              </p>
              <p>
                BUT, please note we still have a very high level of
                qualification criteria to make sure that each and every person
                that becomes part of our team is a great fit for our
                organization. Not only for the company, but also for the rest of
                the team, our clients and most importantly, especially for you.
                We take employment very seriously, and we do not believe in
                short-term thinking. We believe it is a lifelong journey that we
                take together. And hence we should make sure it is a perfect
                fit.

              <h3>Apply for an Internship</h3>
              <p>
                Thank you for your interest in doing an internship at Matogen!
                Internships are intended for final year or graduate students,
                who might consider working for Matogen in future (if all parties
                feel the same excitement after the internship).
              </p>

              <p>
                Due to the high demand and limited capacity, we regrettable have
                criteria. Please take note of the following before applying:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A minimum past academic performance of 70% average is
                  required, but kindly also take note that since only the top
                  applications are accepted, the final cutoff can be higher.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We normally only consider final years, but may reconsider if
                  your marks are very high.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A professional working attitude and willingness to learn and
                  grow are expected.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Internships normally occur during vacations. It is up to you
                  to decide how long you would like to participate, but we
                  normally recommend somewhere between 2-4 weeks.
                </li>
                <li>You please have to provide your own hardware/software</li>
                <li>
                  Most of the time you will not receive any payment unless your
                  internship is of commercial value to the company (which is
                  subject to management’s sole discretion).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We strive to answer each and every application, but kindly allow
                2-3 days for us to process it.
              </p>
