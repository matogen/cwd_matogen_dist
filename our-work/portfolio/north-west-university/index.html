        <p>
          North West University is not just about book knowledge but to equip
          students with practical experience in their field of study before they
          enter the world of work. A number of practical hours are required for
          certain academic programmes as a requirement to complete a
          qualification. Often these practical hours must be completed at
          different service providers at different year levels pending on the
          students' selected modules.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Work Integrated and Service-learning Management System (WISL) is a
          cloud-based system designed to manage, automate and effectively place
          students at different Service Providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students can place themselves at a Service Provider of their choice
          during the placement period by clicking on a link. Mentors can be
          assigned to assess students on work-integrated learning activities.
          The system tracks capacity and scheduling with the registered and
          available Service Provider entities (such as Hospitals and Schools),
          as well as hours of practical work accrued by the student.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mentors and assessors assigned to evaluate the students, can access
          the app via a mobile link where they can view their trip and allowance
          information as well as student and location data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system consolidates 8 API data streams from the existing
          University systems and automates the placement process and the
          management of student practicals.
        </p>
        <p>
          With re-usable modules & components, the system core is designed for
          new modules and components to be added and shared, quickly and easily.
          The layered design and separation between databases, api, and user
          interface allow for upgrades to be executed with ease.
        </p>
        <p>
          The generic core data model caters for multiple Faculties such as
          Education, Nursing, and Pharmacy students. The core offers a
          configurable WIL Office ID functionality to each new NWU school, to
          provide for unique operational needs.
